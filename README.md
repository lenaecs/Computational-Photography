### Summary

The cross stitch pattern generator can be found in the Jupyter notebook "Cross Stitch Pattern Generator.ipynb"

This script takes an image, and outputs a cross stitch pattern in Excel.

If you want to use your own image in this pattern generator, replace the 'image' link in the first cell of the python notebook.

The scale_factor variable determines the size of the final pattern. A scale factor of 25 means the pattern will be 1/25th of the size of the original image.

The pattern will be outputted as an excel file, named pattern.xlsx
